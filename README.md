# HTML-CSS-JS-Portfolio
🤦🏻‍♀️ I was about to create a simple HTML project to practice Sass and CSS - that's how and why this thing is here. I got a lot of fun during this process, while at the same time it keeps growing and looks more and more like my NEXT porfolio...Now there are a lot of duplicated codes inside ( of course HTML 🙄), but it's so cute that I can't give it up half way. So just hard code it for now and will re-do it into React after finished. 🙋🏻‍♀️

## Notes
* Javascript for animations on landing page:
  Get TweenMax and TimelineMax Animation JS on (https://cdnjs.com/libraries/gsap/2.1.3) 

## How to install SASS locally?
* `npm init` 
* `npm install node-sass --save-dev`
*  "scripts": {
    "compile:sass": "node-sass sass/main.scss css/style.css -w"
  } in package.json
* `npm run compile:sass`
